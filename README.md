<!-- Plugin description -->
[Verible](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible) is a SystemVerilog language server by ChipAlliance, which provides linting and formatting (and quick fixes) for SystemVerilog. This plugin integrates Verible into Intellij IDEA. It features:

- Linting on the Fly
- Go to Definition
- Formatting (Coming soon)

## üì¶ Requirements

#### 1. Install Verible

Before starting, you need to download the Verible binary from [its GitHub Release](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible/releases), and add it to your PATH environment variable.

#### 2. Intellij IDEA Ultimate

Only Intellij IDEA Ultimate supports LSP, so you cannot use this plugin with the Community version.

Currently, the language server protocol (LSP) support for Jetbrains IDEs is still in beta (View [JetBrains' Blog](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2023/07/lsp-for-plugin-developers/) for more details).

So this plugin can only support the linting feature by now. We will support the formatting and other features as soon as they are supported by Jetbrains.

#### 3. Third-party SystemVerilog Plugin (Optional but Recommended)

This plugin does NOT include syntax highlighting. So you may need to install another SystemVerilog plugin
`studio.edaphic.sv` from [Jetbrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10695-systemverilog).

Although this plugin itself is free, the above third-party plugin and the Intellij IDEA Ultimate version are both paid, so you need to pay for them. You can [apply for free licenses](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) for education or open-source proposes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Just add Verible binaries (`verible-verilog-ls`) to your PATH environment variable. Then you can use the feature of Verible in Intellij IDEA.

### Linting on the Fly

To custom your linting style, you can create a `.rules.verible_lint` file in your project root directory. You can find the linting rules in [Verible Linter Rule List](https://chipsalliance.github.io/verible/verilog_lint.html).

### Go to Definition

No configuration is needed. Just "Ctrl/Cmd + Click" on the identifier and the editor will jump to its declaration.

Note that the third-party plugin `studio.edaphic.sv` mentioned above also provides this feature.

For more details of Verible, please visit:
- [Verible Linter README](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible/tree/master/verilog/tools/lint)
- [Verible LSP README](https://github.com/chipsalliance/verible/tree/master/verilog/tools/ls)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Know Issues

The LSP support by JetBrains is still in beta, so the features of this plugin may not be stable. 
If you have any problems, please feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/zhutmost/intellij-sv-lsp/issues).

1. Code Completion and Quick Fix are not supported yet. You may see complaint messages from Intellij IDEA.

2. Formatting is supported by Verible, but not supported by Intellij IDEA yet.  

<!-- Plugin description end -->

Besides, the mentioned SystemVerilog plugin (`studio.edaphic.sv` ) is no longer maintained, and it is not compatible with the latest version of Intellij IDEA.
So we provide a modified version of this plugin on [GitHub](https://github.com/zhutmost/intellij-sv-lsp/releases/download/v0.0.1/SystemVerilog.zip). You can choose to install this plugin manually:

<kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>‚öôÔ∏è</kbd> > <kbd>Install plugin from disk...</kbd>

They may obey their license (although it is not maintained), so you can choose to use it or not.
